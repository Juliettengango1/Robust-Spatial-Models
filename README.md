# Robust-Spatial-Models
"Robust Inferential Methods for Spatio-Temporal Data in the Presence of Outliers.
The analysis of spatial data mainly focuses on the covariance structure and the parameters involved, which are typically unknown and need to be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. However, the presence of outlying observations in the data can significantly affect the maximum likelihood estimators of the covariance parameters and the associated uncertainties; consequently, leading to inaccurate predictions and compromised confidence intervals. 

We present an algorithm based the Huber function to compute M-estimators and effectively downweight the influence of outliers during covariance parameter estimation.
